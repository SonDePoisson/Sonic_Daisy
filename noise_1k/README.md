There is a noise line at 1kHz (and resonances; 2kHz, 3kHz, 4kHz, etc.) when using a samplerate of 48kHz and blocksize of 48.
This function can turn on/off the noise line with the left footswtich.

There is a line in the code that changes the blocksize used.
Adjusting the blocksize used from 48 to 12 moves the noiseline to 4kHz and reduces its amplitude.

It is unclear if this noise line is worse in my personal setup/Daisy/build or for the Terrarium in general.
On the official Electro-Smith Daisy forum & slack channel there is also talk of this 1kHz noise line.
There is also some reported evidence of this noise line in the official Electro-Smith Petal product.
